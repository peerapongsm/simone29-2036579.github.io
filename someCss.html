<p1>I love Kpop. I fell in love in Kpop in 2016. Before 2016, I hated Kpop. However, during the summer in 2016,I fell in love with BTS, which is 
the first kpop group that I love. During that summer, I listen to all of their songs and watch all of their dances. I am in love with them.
Then, I started to listen to songs by other Kpop groups, including GOT7, SEVENTEEN, TWICE, BLACKPINK, etc. I started to learn
Kpop dances on my own. It has been 4 years since I fell in love with Kpop, and I've been dancing for almost 3 years already. Now, I am still
a big fan of kpop. I really enjoy listening to kpop and dancing to kpop dances. Fighting!! BTS! WANNA ONE! THE BOYZ! ITZY!</p1>
